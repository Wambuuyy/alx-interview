Here's an example of a `README.md` file for the `0x02-minimum_operations` project:

```markdown
# 0x02. Minimum Operations

## Description

This project involves calculating the minimum number of operations needed to result in exactly `n` characters in a file using only "Copy All" and "Paste" operations. The goal is to devise an efficient algorithm to solve this problem.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand and implement dynamic programming and greedy algorithms.
- Perform prime factorization and understand its application to algorithmic problems.
- Optimize Python code for better performance.
- Utilize basic Python programming skills, including loops, conditionals, and functions.

## Concepts

- **Dynamic Programming:** Breaking down the problem into simpler subproblems and building up the solution.
- **Prime Factorization:** Reducing the problem to finding the sum of the prime factors of the target number `n`.
- **Code Optimization:** Approaching problems from an optimization perspective.
- **Greedy Algorithms:** Choosing the best option at each step.
- **Basic Python Programming:** Proficiency in loops, conditionals, and functions.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your code should be documented
- Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
- All files must be executable

## Files

### 0-minoperations.py

Contains the `minOperations(n)` function, which calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly `n` characters in the file.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Find minimum operations to achieve desired result."""


def minOperations(n):
    """
    Check if n is zero or less.
    Initialize operations=0 and factor=2.
    Loop until n is 1.
    If it's divisible by factor, add the factor
    to the number of operations. After exit of loop, return no of operations.
    """
    if n <= 1:
        return 0
    operations = 0
    factor = 2
    while n > 1:
        while n % factor == 0:
            operations += factor
            n //= factor
        factor += 1
    return operations
```

### 0-main.py

Main file for testing the `minOperations` function.

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
"""
Main file for testing
"""

minOperations = __import__('0-minoperations').minOperations

n = 4
print("Min number of operations to reach {} characters: {}".format(n, minOperations(n)))

n = 12
print("Min number of operations to reach {} characters: {}".format(n, minOperations(n)))
```

## Usage

To run the test file, use the following command:

```sh
./0-main.py
```

This should output:

```text
Min number of operations to reach 4 characters: 4
Min number of operations to reach 12 characters: 7
```
